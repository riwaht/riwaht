### 🧰 What I’m up to
- Interning at **Snowflake** on the Developer Platform team — building REST & Python APIs, improving developer tooling, and writing a lot of tests I’m secretly proud of.
- Developing a **narrative puzzle-platformer game** inspired by *Little Nightmares* and *Inside*. I’m the PM, designer, and developer — characters in Blender, gameplay in Unity, performance tuning everywhere.
- Writing (soon!) about my projects, workflows, and favorite tools.

### 📚 What I’ve done

- **inmind.ai** – Built multiplayer VR simulations, AI-driven NPCs, and an AR SLAM iOS app to track robots in real time.
- **Beirut App** – A mobile restaurant discovery app with LLM-based recommendations, Notion CMS integration, and REST APIs.
- **3D Web Apps** – Interactive portfolio, bike shop, and 3D editor using React + Three.js.
- **Teaching** – Ran robotics and game dev workshops for students, from LEGO Spike PRIME to Unity.

### 🚂 Where I’m headed
- Growing my portfolio with more full-stack apps and immersive experiences.
