### 🧰 What I’m up to
- Interning at **Snowflake** on the Developer Platform team: building REST & Python APIs, improving developer tooling, and writing a lot of tests I’m secretly proud of.
- Developing a **narrative puzzle-platformer game** inspired by *Little Nightmares* and *Inside*. I’m the PM, designer, and developer: characters in Blender, gameplay in Unity, performance tuning everywhere.
- Writing (soon!) about my projects, workflows, and favorite tools.

### 📚 What I’ve done  
- **Snowflake** – Expanded the Developer Platform by adding new API features, integrating SQL parameters, and simplifying workflows for developers through Terraform support.  
- **inmind.ai** – Designed and built advanced simulation systems: multiplayer VR environments, AI-driven NPCs, and an AR SLAM iOS app for real-time robot tracking.  
- **Apps & Platforms** – Created end-to-end products like Beirut App, a restaurant discovery platform with LLM-based recommendations, Notion CMS integration, and REST APIs.  
- **3D & Interactive Web** – Built interactive web apps and tools, from a personal portfolio to a bike shop and custom 3D editor using React + Three.js.  
- **Teaching & Outreach** – Led hands-on workshops in robotics and game development, mentoring students on LEGO Spike PRIME and Unity.
